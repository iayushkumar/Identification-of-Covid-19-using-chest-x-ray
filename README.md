# Identification-of-Covid-19-using-chest-x-ray

# Abstract

**Introduction:** COVID-19, which emerged in December 2019, has had a devastating impact on global health. The virus has rapidly spread worldwide, straining healthcare systems due to testing kit shortages and slow detection methods. The development of an automated and early diagnosis system is crucial to address these challenges.

**Methods:** This study proposes a Deep Learning (DL)-assisted approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection using X-ray images. Various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, including VGG-16, DenseNet121, Xception, Resnet50, a standard CNN model, and a parallel CNN model, were tested for the classification of normal and COVID-19 cases. Comparative studies were conducted, considering aspects such as batch size and learning rate.

**Results:** The study aims to identify the most suitable model for early diagnosis, thus aiding researchers in improving the performance of deep learning models. Additionally, this approach can assist radiologists in verifying their screening results with less effort.

**Keywords:** Resnet50, DenseNet121, Xception, VGG16, Standard CNN, Parallel CNN, Pre-trained model.

This study provides a promising step towards automated and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, potentially contributing to better patient care and healthcare system efficiency.
